# Hi
My name is Vojta Karen. I'm a 30-something from the Czech Republic.

I'm always excited about something, but the subject can change fairly quickly. But it usually comes down to one of these:
 - Playing boardgames
 - Playing video games
 - Cooking
 - 3D modelling, 3D printing and making things
 - Programming and tech
 - Photography
 - Films and TV series

I also spend my time organizing some geeky festivals, like Future Gate and (in the past) Junktown.
